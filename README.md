For this challenge, I built a component to allow users to select players from the list and create their ideal Borussia Mönchengladbach starting eleven.

Rules for this challenge:
* A user can’t insert a player more than once.
* A team can have no more than 1 Goalkeeper
* The starting eleven needs to include 3 Defenders, 4 Midfielders, 3 Attackers.
* The UI should reflect the user choices.
